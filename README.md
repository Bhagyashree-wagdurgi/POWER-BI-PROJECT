🚀 Thrilled to share my latest Power BI project — the Super Store Sales Dashboard!

This interactive dashboard delivers a complete 360° view of sales and profit performance across multiple regions, countries, product categories, and managerial levels.
Designed to empower decision-makers, it transforms complex retail data into clear, data-driven business insights. 📊

💡 Project Overview
The Super Store Sales Dashboard was developed as part of my Power BI training with @Intellipaat,
where I focused on end-to-end business intelligence development — from raw data extraction and transformation to visualization and storytelling.

The dataset represents global superstore transactions, and the objective was to:
✅ Monitor key metrics such as Sales, Profit, and Profit Ratio.
✅ Compare performance across Regions, Categories, Sub-Categories, and Managers.
✅ Highlight top-performing markets and identify improvement areas through data-driven visuals.

📊 Key Highlights & Insights

📈 1. Overall Business Performance
Designed KPIs to track total Sales ($62.3M) and Profit ($1.5M) across the organization.
Used card visuals and trend charts to provide instant clarity on overall business health.

🧮 2. DAX Measures & KPI Development
Created custom DAX measures to calculate critical performance indicators such as Profit Ratio (2.4%), enabling efficiency analysis across segments.
Leveraged advanced functions like CALCULATE(), FILTER(), and DIVIDE() for accurate and dynamic insights.

🌍 3. Regional Performance Analysis
Conducted comparative analysis by Country and Region to evaluate profitability and growth.
Found that Canada emerged as a strong performer with a 7.5% Profit Ratio, while other regions revealed potential optimization opportunities.

📦 4. Product Category Analysis
Discovered that Office Supplies dominated sales with 37.7% contribution, followed by Technology and Furniture.
Visualized sales distribution by Category and Sub-Category, identifying profitable product lines and those needing marketing focus.

🧭 5. Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Incorporated slicers and drill-down capabilities to explore performance by Year, Category, Sub-Category, Region, and Manager.
Enhanced interactivity, allowing decision-makers to view trends from different angles with a single click.
